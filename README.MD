4. Exploratory Data Analysis: The data was thoroughly examined to understand its characteristics and identify potential patterns.
3. Sentiment Analysis Labeling: Labeling the reviews using the [Indonesia-bert-sentiment-classification](https://huggingface.co/mdhugol/indonesia-bert-sentiment-classification) model available in Hugging Face.
4. Text Analysis: Drawing bigrams, trigrams, word clouds from each sentiment category to unleash pattern.
